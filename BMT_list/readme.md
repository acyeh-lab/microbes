## Increase GVHD

| **Microbe**                        | **Effect**                                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron*     | Decreases mucin production                    |
| *Akkermansia muciniphila* (species)| Decreases mucin production (uncertain `?`)    |
| *Enterococcus faecium* (murine)    | Produces metalloprotease                      |
| *Enterococcus faecalis*            | Produces metalloprotease                      |
| *Escherichia coli*                 | Undefined role                                |
| *Rothia mucilaginosa*              | Undefined role                                |
| *Streptococcus* (genus)            | Undefined role                                |
| *Bifidobacterium* (genus)          | Observed in pediatric GVHD                    |
| *Collinsella* (genus)              | Butyrate producer                             |

## Decrease GVHD

| **Microbe**                        | **Effect**                                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| *Bacteroides ovatus*               | Increases mucin production                    |
| *Lactobacillus johnsonii* (species)| Prevents *Enterococcus* domination (uncertain `?`) |
| *Bacillus fragilis*                | Undefined role                                |
| *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*     | Produces butyrate                             |
| *Blautia* (genus)                  | Undefined role                                |
| *Ruminococcus* (genus)             | Undefined role                                |

## Notes
1. **Mucin Production**:
   - Microbes like *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* and *Akkermansia muciniphila* reduce mucin production, contributing to GVHD.
   - *Bacteroides ovatus* increases mucin, which might be protective.

2. **Metalloproteases**:
   - *Enterococcus faecium* and *Enterococcus faecalis* produce metalloproteases, potentially exacerbating GVHD through tissue damage.

3. **Butyrate Producers**:
   - *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* and *Collinsella* produce butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties. These may influence GVHD outcomes.

4. **Uncertainty**: Microbes marked with a `?` have tentative effects and require further evidence.
5. Lactobacilli have been associated with increased risk of GVHD in both human and animal studies
