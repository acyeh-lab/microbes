With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","2018-11-30T03:13:53.252Z","2018-11-30T03:13:53.252Z"

However, it is currently unknown how urinary tract bacteria can modify lithogenesis. The objective of the current study was to determine which specific microbial functions in the urinary tract are associated with calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone formers to better understand how the microbiome contributes to CaOx lithogenesis. Data revealed that individuals with CaOx stones harbored a distinct urinary tract microbiome overall. Specifically, CaOx stone formers had reduced levels of genes associated with oxalate metabolism, as well as transmembrane transport, proteolysis, and oxidation-reduction processes. From 17 draft genomes extracted from the data, genes enriched in the healthy group mapped overwhelming to Lactobacillus crispatus and those associated with CaOx mapped to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia sp. The microbial functions that differentiated the clinical cohorts are associated with known mechanisms of stone formation and thus point to specific urinary tract bacteria that play important roles in the onset of USD.","2021-06-25T21:22:11.807Z","2021-06-25T21:22:11.807Z"

We employed both short and long read sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomes to characterize the intestinal microbiome of a longitudinal cohort of 113 preterm infants born between 24 to 33 weeks of gestation. Enabled by enhanced taxonomic resolution, we found significantly increased abundance of Bifidobacterium breve and a diet rich in mothers breastmilk to be associated with intestinal barrier maturation during the first week of life. We combined these factors using genome resolved metagenomics and identified a highly specialized genetic capability of the Bifidobacterium strains to assimilate human milk oligosaccharides and host derived glycoproteins. Our study revealed mechanistic roles of breastmilk feeding and intestinal microbial colonization in postnatal intestinal barrier maturation; these observations are critical towards advancing therapeutics to prevent and treat hyperpermeable gut-associated conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis.","2021-11-30T20:40:17.664Z","2021-11-30T20:40:17.664Z"

The role of microbiota in this process remains largely uncharacterized. We employed both short and long read sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomes to characterize the intestinal microbiome of a longitudinal cohort of 113 preterm infants born between 24 to 33 weeks of gestation. Enabled by enhanced taxonomic resolution, we found significantly increased abundance of Bifidobacterium breve and a diet rich in mothers breastmilk to be associated with intestinal barrier maturation during the first week of life. We combined these factors using genome resolved metagenomics and identified a highly specialized genetic capability of the Bifidobacterium strains to assimilate human milk oligosaccharides and host derived glycoproteins. Our study revealed mechanistic roles of breastmilk feeding and intestinal microbial colonization in postnatal intestinal barrier maturation; these observations are critical towards advancing therapeutics to prevent and treat hyperpermeable gut-associated conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis.","2021-11-30T20:40:28.575Z","2021-11-30T20:40:28.575Z"
