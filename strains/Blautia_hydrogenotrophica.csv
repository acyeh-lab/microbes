Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.;derived from environmental source","2016-01-17T15:31:04.934Z","2016-01-17T15:31:04.934Z"

This strain (S5a33) is the type strain for this species. It was isolated from the feces of a non-methane-excreting human subject. Strain DSM 10507 has the ability to catalyze the synthesis of acetate from CO2 or other one-carbon compounds in the human gut. This reductive acetogenic pathway is potentially beneficial for human nutrition and health for two main reasons: first, it decreases the total volume of gases (H2 and CO2) produced in the colon; second, the acetate produced is a non-gaseous metabolite used by eukaryotic cells as an energy source. Sequencing of this genome is part of the Human Gut Microbiome project.","2016-01-17T15:28:14.167Z","2016-01-17T15:28:14.167Z"
