# Class II elution experiments with Monash

## In this experiment, we pulled down I-Ab peptides from naive mice (3 mice pooled into 1)

## Ideas on post-translationally modified peptides
One question is whether during oxidative stress, we see more PTM changes (e.g. oxidation, phosphorylation) that would general novel T-cell epitopes following allo SCT (vs. syn SCT).  It is widely known that a variety of autoimmune responses in human diseases depend on PTMs of self-proteins (e.g. citrullination in RA).  Here are some sources to look at:
