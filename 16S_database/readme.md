# Constructing a 16S rRNA database
This branch describes how to build a microbial 16S database for blast searching and MSA

# Downloading NCBI's "Microbial 16S RNA sequences from the RefSeq Targeted Loci project"
In command line / shell, run the following:
```
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/16S_ribosomal_RNA.tar.gz
```
